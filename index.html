                <p>“Thirty years ago, we used to ask: Can a computer simulate all processes of logic? The answer was yes, but the question was surely wrong. We should have asked: Can logic simulate all sequences of cause and effect? And the answer would have been no.”

                <p>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.</p>
